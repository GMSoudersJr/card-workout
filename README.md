<p align='center'>A <em>mobile-first</em>, <em>web-based</em> card workout app <a href='https://card-workout-tau.vercel.app/'>SUIT YOURSELF</p>

## Motivation

During the pandemic, I was intrigued by a video of a boxer using a deck of cards to determine the number of push-ups he would do.
After trying it a few times...

> [!Warning]
> Doing only one exercise for a full deck is **OVERKILL!**

My *spin* on it was to have each suit represent a different exercise instead of a <ins>full deck</ins> of push-ups.

> [!Tip]
> ♣️ = Crunches (core exercise)
> 
> ♦️ = Jumping Jacks (4 corners, 4 body parts move)
> 
> ♥️ = Push-ups (an exercise I love)
> 
> ♠️ = Squats (leg exercise)

Also, friends were interested as well, but they did not want to carry around a deck of cards.

## The Exercises
The exercises are *calisthenic* and *yoga* based *movements*. No need for *added* weight, use ***yourself***.

## Current Status

The app can be used, but there is no tracking of progress.

## Future Plans

> [!Note]
> Connect a backend so users can:
> - login and track their exercises / workouts
> - save a workout and continue later
> - time workouts
> - save completed workouts
> - repeat workouts to see improvements in conditioning
