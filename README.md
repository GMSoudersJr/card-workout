# [SUIT YOURSELF](https://card-workout-tau.vercel.app/)

A **mobile-first** web-based card workout app [`SUIT YOURSELF`](https://card-workout-tau.vercel.app/)

## Motivation

During the pandemic, I was intrigued by a video of a boxer using a deck of cards to determine the number of push-ups he would do.
After trying it a few times, doing only push-ups was **OVERKILL**.

My *spin* on it was to have each suit represent a different exercise instead of a full deck of push-ups.

♣️ = Crunches (core exercise)

♦️ = Jumping Jacks (4 corners, 4 body parts move)

♥️ = Push-ups (an exercise I love)

♠️ = Squats (leg exercise)

Also, friends wanted to try it, but they did not want to carry around a deck of cards

## The Exercises
The exercises are calisthenics, movement, and yoga based. No need for added weight, use yourself.

## Current Status

The app can be used, but there is no tracking of progress.

## Future Plans

Connect a backend so users can:
- login and track their exercises / workouts
- save a workout and continue later
- time workouts
- save completed workouts
- repeat workouts to see improvements in conditioning
